# This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app

It serves as a template repository.

Configured with mdx generated page functionality

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Currently the project has two pages.

- The root directory is the page generated by mdx, e.g. <http://localhost:3000/>.
- The tsx generated page, e.g. <http://localhost:3000/page>.
